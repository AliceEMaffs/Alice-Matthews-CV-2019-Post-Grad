Simulated the molecular evolution at various stages of the gravitational collapse of the molecular cloud into a pre-stellar core, whilst altering chemistry and other parameters to measure the importance of initial cloud chemistry and other physical phenomena.
 
 \item Developed Python and FORTRAN scripts to compute the ionisation rate and ice desorption by cosmic rays. 
 
 \item Performed extensive studies on the ortho-para ratio of water (HHO-H2O), the results of which are published in the following paper: \url{https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz1531}.

OBSERVER at IRAM 30m Telescope, Sierra Nevada, Spain\\
\textsc{Jun. - Sep.}\textsc{2017}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,topsep=0pt,noitemsep,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt,rightmargin=0.2cm]
\setlength\itemsep{0em}

 \item Worked at IRAM observatory in the Sierra Nevada for 7 days as part of an external research program dedicated to studying discrepancies between nitrogen-bearing species in proto-stellar cores. 
 
 \item Learned observing techniques for the IRAM 30~m radio telescope by performing supervised and solo observations (summing a total of 70 observing hours) in the sub-millimetre radio range. I learned how to calibrate, point and focus the telescope as well as perform a mapping of the sky. 
 
 \item I was introduced to the workings of radio telescopes. In addition to this, in a masters year module I learned the main principles in radio-astronomy such as heterodyne receivers, telescope sensitivity, noise and calibration methods, amplification, mixers, auto-correlation and spectrometer principles.
 
 \item Measured nitrogen isotopic ratios using spectroscopy techniques in proto-stellar cores in using software such as GILDAS and Xephem.
 %(specifically L1498, L1544 and L183 core regions).
 
 \item Observed quantum transitions of HCN and HNC and 13C and 15N isotopologues in the L1498 Taurus environment. 
 
 \item This experience is one I will cherish and has given me much motivation and passion to further my understanding in the science and technology.

SUMMER INTERN at MBDA, Bristol\\
WSSE | \small\emph{Weapons System Simulation and Experimentation} \\
\textsc{Jun. - Sep.}\textsc{2017}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,topsep=0pt,noitemsep,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt,rightmargin=0.2cm]
\setlength\itemsep{0em}

 \item Responsible for editing and testing software using VBS, GitHub, GUI in C++. Connecting multiple networks with the simulator systems (test-bed) using distributed system methods.
  
 \item Developed a simulation environment along with thorough documentation ensuring user guides were accurate and readable as well as following security and company standards, all met with a strict deadlines for its handover to an external organisation at the world leading defence show DSEI.
 
 \item I had the opportunity to work as an exhibitor in London for 10 days at DSEI. I was responsible for giving simulation demonstrations to guests and other organisations, including governmental bodies. This was an amazing opportunity and improved my communications and confidence immensely.
 
 \item Throughout my time at MBDA, I expressed high enthusiasm, worked on multiple projects, testing my project management and organisation skills and was invited back for a further placement in 2018.

LAB WORK at JODRELL BANK, Manchester\\
\textsc{Crab Pulsar Experiment} | \small\emph{Radio astronomy - observing pulsar and light sources}\\
\textsc{ Sep. - Oct.} \textsc{2017}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,topsep=0pt,noitemsep,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt,rightmargin=0.5cm]
 \setlength\itemsep{0em}
 
    \item Worked at Jodrell Bank for 6 weeks. This experience sparked my initial interest in radio-astronomy as well as improving my team building, punctuation, communication and project management skills.
    
    \item First hand experience in radio astronomy obtaining and analysing pulsar data from the Lovell and 42ft telescopes. 
    
    \item This experience enhanced my ability to use new equipment effectively and I developed an understanding how radio systems work.
    
    \item Wrote small scripts in C++ to study pulsar harmonics.
    %using FFT techniques, correcting for time delays such as for Solar System barycentric corrections and in obtaining true arrival time data. 
    This greatly improved my logical thinking, programming and understanding of handling and analysing raw data as well as using radio-astronomy data methods.

    \item The technical work on equipment and ability to analyse data advanced dramatically. I gained multiple new skills and confidence in methods of calibration, analysis techniques and data manipulation. Results were concluded and presented in a lab report and an hour presentation.

MPHYS at THE UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER\\ 
 \textsc {Graduated with a 2:1} | \small\emph{81\% in Final Masters Project}\\

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,topsep=0pt,noitemsep,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt,rightmargin=0.5cm]

    \item Completed a six month masters project working alongside my supervisor Professor Terrance Wyatt, and laboratory partner Luca Gaidoni. The project was working on the ATLAS experiment at CERN, in attempt to observe the  decay of two $\tau$ particles, from the electroweak production of a $Z$ boson in association with two jets, via the vector boson fusion of two $W$ bosons. This project enabled me to improve of my software skills, through extensive use of the software package ROOT v6, with object-oriented programming in C and C++, as well as writing small scripts in Python and handling large amounts of data. I loved working alongside my colleagues and have learnt the importance of consistency, communication and discipline throughout this project. 
    
    \item Programming courses: C++ object-oriented programming: 78\%, Python: 72\%, I am also familiar with MATLAB, FORTRAN and Scientific Linux, used in other research projects.
    
    \item As a physics masters student I have learned to approach challenging concepts and problems. I have learnt to handle uncomfortable situations where the answer to a problem is not obvious, and that the solution is often found through determination, patience and practise.
    
    \item I am approachable, friendly and extremely driven and love learning new skills and being challenged as well as helping in external projects to further widen my experience and skills and partaking in Outreach events.
    %\item I have many personal and academic interests including high energy particle physics,radio astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology, communications, software, climate change and the environment, human and animal rights.
